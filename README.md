Replicate the post-processing steps for cell cluster splitting as described in
Zhang et el. *Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry in Living Bacterial Biofilms* (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.28.120279).

This repository has currrently limited functionality:
- tested on MATLAB R2019a and higher
- 2D input data
- threshold-based semantic segmentation
